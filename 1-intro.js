/*
    Introduction

    Axios is a react library which is used to call third party API from the backend
    or the server.
    It is similar to the fetch API however the syntax is better. It can be used with
    vanilla javascript, node js or for vue applications.

    Axios always returns a promise so .then is used to consume it, catch is used for
    error handling and finally for rendering data inspite of .then or catch. Async and await
    also can be used.

    Library can be imported from npm to use axios.
